Math-BigInt-GMP

Math::BigInt::GMP is a replacement library for Math::BigInt::Calc that
reimplements some of the Math::BigInt::Calc functions in XS. It can be used
via:

    use Math::BigInt lib => 'GMP';

This package contains a replacement (drop-in) module for Math::BigInt's core,
Math::BigInt::Calc.pm.

INSTALLATION

You need to install the Gnu MP library aka libgmp to compile this module.

How to install (replace the version below with the current one):

    tar -xzf Math-BigInt-GMP-1.12.tar.gz
    cpansign --verify

If the signature does not verify ok, you might to install Module::Signature.
If the signature still does not verify okay, notify me. DO NO INSTALL this
package when the signature is BAD - your system might get compromised!

If the signature is good, do:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you have trouble compiling this package because the GMP library is
installed in a non-standard location, try to pass the INC and LIBS
arguments to Makefile.PL with the appropriate information. Here
is an example:

        perl Makefile.PL\
         INC="-I/apps/perl588/site/gmp-4.2.1/include"\
         LIBS="-L/apps/perl588/site/gmp-4.2.1/lib -lgmp"

To use this module, replace:

    use Math::BigInt;

with this:

    use Math::BigInt lib => 'GMP';

or alternatively something like:

    use Math::BigInt lib => 'GMP,Pari,FastCalc';

Please read the documentation under PERFORMANCE in Math::BigInt on when to use
this module and when not. As of v1.10 and Math::BigInt v1.64/v1.64, using "lib
=> 'GMP'" will actually reduce the memory consumption of your program, and
thanks to the fact that we no longer use Math::GMP but have our own XS code,
almost all operations should be faster than just using Calc (the default
pure-perl library used in Math::BigInt).

So, the following:

    use Math::BigInt lib => 'GMP';

can be heartily recommended.

SUPPORT

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.

    perldoc Math::BigInt::GMPz
